# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the **telecom sector**, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing **customer churn**.
- Develop a **machine learning model** to predict at-risk customers.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce **customer attrition**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI/Tableau** (for visualization)
- **SQL** (for data processing & feature engineering)

## 📂 Project Structure

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- **Key Churn Indicators:** High call drop rates, low data usage, long customer support wait times.
- **Customer Segments at Risk:** Prepaid users & low ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) customers.
- **Retention Strategies:** Personalized offers, improved customer service, loyalty programs.

## 🔍 Future Scope
- Implement **deep learning models** for better prediction accuracy.
- Develop a **real-time churn monitoring dashboard**.
- Enhance **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques.
